Suppose in one school there are classes from Class-1 to Class-10 with sections,
but here in school total tuition period is 7, and separately one  lunch and short break.
So please make logic for Subject, Teacher and  Class and tuition period allocations.
--------------------------------------------------

To handle the allocation of **Subjects**, **Teachers**, and **Classes** across **tuition periods**, we need to design a timetable system. Here's how we can extend the database schema and logic to accommodate this requirement:

---

### **Updated Schema**

#### **1. Tuition Periods Table**
This table will store the tuition periods (e.g., Period 1, Period 2, etc.) along with breaks and lunch.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TuitionPeriods (
    period_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    period_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., "Period 1", "Lunch", "Short Break"
    start_time TIME NOT NULL, -- Start time of the period
    end_time TIME NOT NULL, -- End time of the period
    is_break BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE -- Indicates if it's a break or lunch
);
```

---

#### **2. Timetable Allocations Table**
This table will map **Subjects**, **Teachers**, **Classes**, and **Sections** to specific **Tuition Periods** for each day of the week.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TimetableAllocations (
    allocation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    section_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Sections(section_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    teacher_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES TeacherProfiles(teacher_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    subject_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Subjects(subject_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    period_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES TuitionPeriods(period_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (day_of_week IN ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')),
    UNIQUE (section_id, period_id, day_of_week) -- Ensures no duplicate allocations for a section on the same day and period
);
```

---

### **Logic for Allocations**

1. **Tuition Periods**:
   - Define the 7 tuition periods, lunch, and short breaks in the `TuitionPeriods` table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO TuitionPeriods (period_name, start_time, end_time, is_break)
     VALUES
     ('Period 1', '08:00:00', '08:45:00', FALSE),
     ('Period 2', '08:45:00', '09:30:00', FALSE),
     ('Short Break', '09:30:00', '09:45:00', TRUE),
     ('Period 3', '09:45:00', '10:30:00', FALSE),
     ('Period 4', '10:30:00', '11:15:00', FALSE),
     ('Lunch', '11:15:00', '12:00:00', TRUE),
     ('Period 5', '12:00:00', '12:45:00', FALSE),
     ('Period 6', '12:45:00', '13:30:00', FALSE),
     ('Period 7', '13:30:00', '14:15:00', FALSE);
     ```

2. **Timetable Allocations**:
   - Allocate subjects, teachers, and classes to specific periods for each day of the week.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO TimetableAllocations (section_id, teacher_id, subject_id, period_id, day_of_week)
     VALUES
     (1, 1, 1, 1, 'Monday'), -- Class 1-A, Teacher 1, Mathematics (Basic), Period 1, Monday
     (1, 2, 2, 2, 'Monday'), -- Class 1-A, Teacher 2, Science (Basic), Period 2, Monday
     (1, 3, 3, 3, 'Monday'); -- Class 1-A, Teacher 3, English (Basic), Period 3, Monday
     ```

3. **Constraints**:
   - A teacher cannot be assigned to two different sections at the same time on the same day.
   - A section cannot have two subjects at the same time on the same day.

---

### **Example Queries**

1. **Get the timetable for Class 1-A on Monday**:
   ```sql
   SELECT t.period_name, s.subject_name, tp.first_name, tp.last_name
   FROM TimetableAllocations ta
   JOIN TuitionPeriods t ON ta.period_id = t.period_id
   JOIN Subjects s ON ta.subject_id = s.subject_id
   JOIN TeacherProfiles tp ON ta.teacher_id = tp.teacher_id
   WHERE ta.section_id = 1 AND ta.day_of_week = 'Monday'
   ORDER BY t.start_time;
   ```

2. **Get all periods where a specific teacher is assigned**:
   ```sql
   SELECT t.period_name, ta.day_of_week, c.class_name, sec.section_name
   FROM TimetableAllocations ta
   JOIN TuitionPeriods t ON ta.period_id = t.period_id
   JOIN Sections sec ON ta.section_id = sec.section_id
   JOIN Classes c ON sec.class_id = c.class_id
   WHERE ta.teacher_id = 1 -- Replace with the desired teacher's ID
   ORDER BY ta.day_of_week, t.start_time;
   ```

3. **Check if a teacher is free during a specific period**:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM TimetableAllocations
   WHERE teacher_id = 1 AND period_id = 3 AND day_of_week = 'Monday';
   -- If no rows are returned, the teacher is free during this period.
   ```

---

### **Use Cases**

1. **Allocate Subjects to Classes**:
   - Use the `ClassSubjectAssignments` table to define which subjects are taught in which classes.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO ClassSubjectAssignments (class_id, subject_id)
     VALUES
     (1, 1), -- Class 1, Mathematics (Basic)
     (1, 2); -- Class 1, Science (Basic)
     ```

2. **Assign Teachers to Subjects**:
   - Use the `TeacherSubjectAssignments` table to define which teachers can teach which subjects.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO TeacherSubjectAssignments (teacher_id, subject_id)
     VALUES
     (1, 1), -- Teacher 1 can teach Mathematics (Basic)
     (2, 2); -- Teacher 2 can teach Science (Basic)
     ```

3. **Create Timetable**:
   - Use the `TimetableAllocations` table to assign subjects, teachers, and classes to specific periods and days.

---

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Holidays**: Add a `Holidays` table to exclude specific days from the timetable.
- **Repeating Timetable**: If the timetable repeats every week, no additional logic is needed. If it varies, add a `week_number` column to the `TimetableAllocations` table.
- **Teacher Availability**: Add a `TeacherAvailability` table to define when teachers are unavailable (e.g., due to meetings or leave).
